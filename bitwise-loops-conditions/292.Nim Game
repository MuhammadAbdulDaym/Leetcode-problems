// lets number is 27 we will try to make it number divisible by 4 and we can move only three steps in this case we will move 3 steps
// to make it 24 and in next when opponent choose 1 we will try to make it 4 steps like we will move 3 steps ( 1+3 = 4) if opponent
// move 2 steps will will move 2 steps but if number given is divisble by 4 and we have to move first then we will always lose
